                    <p>You can pinpoint the exact moment when Apple lost the WWDC audience on Monday.
                    John Ternus, the company's VP of hardware engineering, had just revealed that the 
                    <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/03/apple-retina-6k-display/">Pro Display XDR</a>,
                    its new high-end 6K monitor, will cost $4,999. That's pricey, but reasonable considering all of the features
                    it offers. But then there was one more thing, and not the good kind. One hour, forty two minutes and five seconds
                    into the keynote stream, he revealed that the Pro Display's stand is a separate $999 purchase. The crowd, which
                    was mostly enthusiastic until then, erupted into cautious murmurs -- enough to make Ternus stammer as he continued on.
                    He was completely unprepared for the Apple faithful to question the glorious technology being bestowed upon them.</p>
